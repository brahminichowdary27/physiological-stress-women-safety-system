Physiological Stress Based Automatic Women Safety Alert System
Problem

In many emergency situations, victims are unable to manually call or send alerts. Existing safety apps depend on user interaction, which may fail during panic, unconsciousness, or physical restraint.

Proposed Solution

A wearable embedded system that automatically detects abnormal physiological stress conditions and sends an emergency alert with live location to predefined contacts.

System Overview

The device continuously monitors physiological signals.
When values cross a danger threshold, the controller triggers an automatic alert without requiring user action.

Flow:
Sensor Data → Microcontroller Processing → Threshold Detection → GSM Alert + Location Sharing

Hardware Components

Physiological / Heart rate sensor

Microcontroller

GSM module

GPS module

Buzzer

Power supply

Working Principle

Sensors continuously monitor body condition

Microcontroller checks abnormal stress patterns

If threshold exceeded → emergency triggered

GSM module sends SMS alert

GPS shares real-time location

Features

Fully automatic emergency alert

No manual trigger required

Real-time location sharing

Wearable implementation

Fast response during panic situations

Result

System successfully demonstrated automatic alert generation during simulated stress conditions and transmitted location to registered contacts.
